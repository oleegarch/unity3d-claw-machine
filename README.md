# 🎰 Unity3D Claw Machine

A real but virtual **claw machine** on the screen controlled by touch or mouse 🎯
It was created in 2023 with the aim of exploring 3D in unity + playing around in Blender. As always, my experiment dragged on for a couple of months because I decided to want to post this game and create a whole server-side validation of the game's integrity by fully simulating on the server all user actions performed in the batch to confirm the authenticity of the game.
